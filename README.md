# AUBoutiqueI

**Project Overview:**

This project implements a client-server architecture for an e-commerce platform called AUBoutique. It allows users to register, login, view products, add products, buy products, view buyers of products, and text with another user. This system is composed of two parts: 
1. Server: The server handles client requests, manages the database, and helps the communication between clients. 
2. Client: The client is the one interacting with the system and requesting certain actions to be performed. 

It is important to note that SQLite database is used in this project to store the user's data (username, password, products, messages,...). The server automatically creates "auboutique.db" database. 

Another note worth mentioning is the use of socket to handle the communication between the client and server codes. 


**Instructions for running the project:**

Step 1: Set up the server code 
  - Open the terminal
  - Navigate to the directory containing "server.py" (example: cd desktop)
  - Execute the following command: "python server.py"
  - The server will start listening for connections at port 8005.

Step 2: Set up the client code
  - Open a new window in the terminal
  - Navigate to the directory containing "client.py" (example: cd desktop)
  - Execute the following command: "python client.py"
  - The client will connect and display the options menu (example: register, login, or exit)

*Note:* It is important to run the server code first since the client will attempt to connect to the server at localhost:8005. 


**Dependencies/external libraries needed for the project:** 

Running the project requires Python version 3 (Python 3.x) and the following libraries: 
  - socket (for network communication) 
  - json (for json messages and their encoding and decoding) 
  - threading (to handle multiple client connections)
  - sqlite3 (for server database)
